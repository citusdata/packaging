pg-auto-failover (1.5.2-1) stable; urgency=low
  
  This is a bugfix release for the v1.5 series.
  
  In addition to bug fixes, this release also contains a lift of the
  restriction to always have at least two nodes with a non-zero candidate
  priority in a group. It is now possible to use pg_auto_failover and only
  have manual failover.
  
  If you're using the output from the command `pg_autoctl show settings
  --json` please notice that we changed the JSON format we use in the output.
  See #697 for details.

pg-auto-failover (1.6.1-1) stable; urgency=low
  
  This release contains monitor schema changes, so the monitor extension gets
  a version bump from 1.5 to 1.6, and this is the first release in the 1.6
  series.
  
  In this release we introduce a new state in the FSM: "dropped". This state
  allows a node to realise it's been dropped from the monitor, and act
  accordingly (mostly, stops cleanly and register it's been dropped).
  
  This means that the command `pg_autoctl drop node` now only completes when
  the node that is being dropped is still reachable. To drop a node that is
  unreachable (e.g. machine died), you should now use the command `pg_autoctl
  drop node --force`.
