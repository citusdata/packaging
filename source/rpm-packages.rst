RPM Packages

Introduction to RPM packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RPM packaging is a common method used to create software packages for RPM-based Linux distributions. RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) provides a reliable and consistent way to install, upgrade, and remove software components. The packaging format used in RPM is known as the RPM package format or `.rpm`.

RPM-specific tools and conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RPM packaging relies on a set of tools and conventions to streamline the packaging process. Familiarize yourself with the following:

- **rpmbuild**: The `rpmbuild` command is the primary tool for building RPM packages. It compiles the source code, creates the package structure, and generates the final RPM package.

- **.spec file**: The `.spec` file is a key component of RPM packaging. It contains detailed instructions and metadata about the package, such as its name, version, release, dependencies, build requirements, and file locations. The `.spec` file defines the build process, file ownership, permissions, and other package-specific configurations.

- **rpmlintrc**: The `rpmlintrc` file is used to configure the rpmlint tool, which performs static analysis on the generated RPM package. The rpmlint tool checks for common packaging issues, compliance with guidelines, and potential errors. The `rpmlintrc` file allows you to specify specific checks to enable or disable for your package.

Additional RPM Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the core RPM packaging components, the packaging process may involve other files with specific purposes. Here are some additional RPM-related files commonly used:

- **.spec file**: The `.spec` file contains the build instructions and metadata for the RPM package.

- **rpmlintrc**: The `rpmlintrc` file configures the rpmlint tool for checking the package.
