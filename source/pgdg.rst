Citus PGDG Packages
====================

Citus packages for RPM-based distributions are made available through the PGDG (PostgreSQL Global Development Group) repository.
PGDG is a repository that provides PostgreSQL packages for various Linux distributions.

It is important to note that the packaging process for Citus packages in PGDG is not directly managed by us.
Instead, we open an issue in the PGDG repository and Devrim Gunduz, the owner of PGDG, takes care of the packaging process.
